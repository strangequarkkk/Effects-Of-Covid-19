# Effects Of Covid-19

Python libraries used: Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot.

In this Coursework/Project:

I analyzed the effects of Covid-19 from early March until just before Christmas 2020 by presenting the data acquired from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download more clearly. I compared the weekly deaths caused by COVID-19 to the weekly deaths caused by Influenza and other causes. Also worked with a model which very crudely followed the trend in weekly infections observed between week 28-38 during the pandemic.

Plotted and studied a simpler implementation of the SIR model, which was used to model the pandemic.

I have attached the relevant question sheet and recommend that it be read while you're looking at the code. The programs were written in a Jupyter Notebook which has also been attached.

Data file(s) used have also been attached.

If you need any more information/explanation related to the code, don't hesitate to contact me.
